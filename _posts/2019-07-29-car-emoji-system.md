Recently I got my driving license (finally!) at the age of 22. I know it’s late, but it’s better than never. As I am going to the US to pursue master’s and PhD’s study, a driving license would be necessary regarding the automobile culture in the states.

However, I came to notice an interesting fact. Before I learn to drive, I couldn’t understand why people get angry during driving. Everyone is annoyed by other drivers on the road, no matter who is driving “wrongly”. But when I get to drive, I get easily annoyed, either. Sometimes I don’t even realize I was angry already. I believe this is what we call “Road Rage”.

So let’s talk about Road Rage today. I see drivers blaring at the cars in front of them just because they delayed for like, 1 second literally, when the traffic lights turn green. If someone drove in a wrong way and try to turn around, or tried to park along the road, there will always be a driver blaring behind, maybe even rolled the window down and gives out a finger. Why is that? Why everyone is in such a rush? Could they just wait for one second?

Causes to Road Rage are vary, including:

1. Personal factors such as age, gender, beliefs and emotions.
Some stress factors such as blocked traffic, tight time, road works or hot weather
2. Our understanding of certain things: for example, thinking that others are targeting me (“They deliberately did this to me!”), disaster mood (“You may have taken my life!”), discrimination (“These drivers/women drivers are too bad!”), and standard violent emotions (“Are you blind?”)
3. Other factors, such as the sense of anonymity we feel in the car, and the inability to communicate emotionally through other means. This is what I am going to talk about later
4. In fact, many of the behaviors that are caused by anger during driving, including screaming horns, swearing, and making indecent gestures, may eventually lead to people walking out of the cars for fights, or serious car accidents. A recent study confirmed the association between “Road Rage” and some aggressive and risky behaviors. The study found that anger generated during driving can effectively predict aggressive driving and many accidents.

This is not a new phenomenon. People who usually perform well can become angry once they drive a car. This theory has been with us since the car appeared. I remember that in 1950 Disney produced an animated short film “Motor Mania”, The character Goofy inside was a very gentle person at the beginning, and later he became a monster whenever he sat behind the wheels.

“I am a good driver, but what about everyone else?”

Well, since “Road Rage” is a common phenomena that cannot be eliminated easily, can we “relieve the symptoms”? One of the major reason mentioned above can be deeply investigated. The inability to communicate emotionally through other means when sitting behind the wheels. What if we can communicate with other drivers?

Hang on for a second. Are you suggesting that we deliver messages by some kind of visual or acoustic way? It could be dangerous during driving! Yes indeed, text information delivering and receiving could be dangerous when driving, but how about simple image messages, like emojis? People process image information way more faster than text. That’s why visualization research exists. We just need a glimpse at the pictures to receive the meanings. So I was thinking that we could add emoji display device around the car to express your feelings when driving. You don’t have to be hostile if the driver in front of you tagged a 🙇 emoji saying they are sorry because they needed turn around. How adorable! Maybe you could return a 👌 emoji back. Sounds like losing temper could be avoided!

I see this car emoji system an upgrade to the turn signal on every car. We could add more signals to show to cars around you. However, safety concern is also important since it takes time for drivers to enter an emoji. Well, the input efficiency problem can be solved in many ways, like using a camera recognizing drivers gestures.

Also, future studies like how this system would affect drivers’ behaviors need to be investigated further. For now it’s just a brainstorm!
