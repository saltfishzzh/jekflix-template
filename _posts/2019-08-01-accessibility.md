This might be the scene that elicits the most tears and sympathy in listeners from the 2019 Weibo Trending hotlist. 

A public welfare person dedicated to promoting obstacle-free travel accessibility has fallen on the road to obstacles.

Jun Wen, a name that is well known in the circle. Behind him, there are 85 million Chinese disabled people who can't even get out of the door. Yes you are seeing it right, 85 million.

He has influenced and changed a large number of people with disabilities, allowing them to face themselves and giving them the courage to step out of their homes and start their own lives. But yet he himself, on the way to find the way for everyone, left forever.

If the private car did not block the obstacle-free access, or if there was a warning sign at the entrance to the underground garage, the tragedy would not happen at all. 

### 1

This is not the first travel for Jun since long ago. He had seen the flag waving in front of Tiananmen Square, boarded the Great Wall, and went to the South Africa, Vietnam, India, Nepal...

You may feel that there is nothing special about these experiences.

However, if you understand his past, if you know that he is a disabled person in a wheelchair, you would be more than respectful of these experiences.

![](/assets/img/posts/access1.jpeg)

In 1997, a 25-year-old young man from Ningxia, Guyuan named Jun Wen drove a truck to deliver goods. The mountain road was rugged and an accident occurred.

He suffered severe spinal cord injury and high paraplegia. For a long time after that, he was depressed, accompanied by a bed, not willing to go out, and refuse to meet any people.

In 1999, he moved from his hometown to Pok Oi Hospital for treatment. It was during this time that his mindset changed dramatically. He began to learn to use a wheelchair and became proficient; he could go to bed, wear clothes, and sit on the toilet.

After leaving the hospital, he decided to stay in Beijing.

The family wanted to stay and take care of him, but he didn't want to burden the family that was already too tired, and he also wanted to be independent just on his own, so he insisted and persuaded the family to go back.

He rented a house near Fengtaijiamen North Road and supported himself by selling a small amount of phone cards.

The place where he purchased the goods was more than 20 kilometers away from him. He himself walked in a wheelchair and then returned in this very wheelchair.

Finally, he could be self-reliant.

But his ambitions didn't stop there, he wanted to help more people like him and help them start their own lives.

Thus, in 2006, Wenjun founded the "Home of the Beijing Paralympics."

![](/assets/img/posts/access3.jpeg)

Here, Jun set up rehabilitation equipment to help them recover and teach them to do something they can.

He learned English by himself, interacted with international supporting organizations for the disabled, and invited experts to give lectures on the Internet to spread knowledge about paraplegia treatment and rehabilitation.

The patients gathered here for each other. He cheered them up and encouraged them to get out of their homes and integrate into society. Since 2006, he had organized 11 events of “SCI Feel the Sun, Enjoy the Happiness”.

In order to ensure the safety of the patients, every time they planned on traveling, Jun must travel first to ensure obstacle-free.

![](/assets/img/posts/access4.jpeg)

He needed to decide what kind of route is right for them to go, whether the hotel has obstacle-free facilities, how to coordinate the volunteers, and what kind of bus to rent.

He didn't want anyone traveling with him to feel uncomfortable.

The hotel is not enough just with obstacle-free facilities. He also needed to see whether the width of the door can guarantee the passage of most wheelchairs or the distance between the toilet and the shower can be obtained by reaching out.

He would go to experience all these one by one. He also had to consider the price of the hotel. They who need rehabilitation for many years couldn't afford too much.

Every time he travels, he would form a complete report and send it to everyone.

In order to reduce costs, he was traveling all alone for each visit. A wheelchair, a small box, a satchel are all he needed.

He and his patients in wheelchairs had appeared in Beijing, Xi'an, Nanjing, Chengdu, Sanya, Inner Mongolia...

Jun is enthusiastic, positive, optimistic and careful. In the past few years, he had influenced a large number of people.

Patient Jinping Wang remembers that a heavy snow in 2016 Beijing blocked his way back to the “Paraplegia House”. He was worried, but Jun called to tell him that he had already arranged someone to pick him up.

When he returned to the house, there was a bowl of hot soup prepared by Jun for him.

If someone had something to tell, they would go to Jun for a couple of hours.

Under his influence, some people began to face their bodies and tried to get out of the haze; some people began to walk out of the house and take the train alone.

He had brought hope to many people, and he is the spiritual pillar of many paraplegic patients.

It was planned as before this time. If nothing unexpected happened, Jun was ready to lead the patients to travel across three cities: Kunming, Dali, and Lijiang, for a total of 10 days.

Many people may yearn for a travel route in their minds, and paraplegic patients are the same.

![](/assets/img/posts/access6.jpeg)

Wenjun started from Beijing and arrived in Kunming after more than 30 hours of trains.

A few days ago, he just updated his status about bus and places of interests arrangements.

On July 6, he arrived in Dali. On this day he updated his status for four times and after that there was no more news.

![](/assets/img/posts/access7.jpeg)

On the evening of the 7th, he completed a day of visiting and returned to the hotel as usual. But no one expected that the barrier-free passage was occupied by private cars. Helpless, he could only find another way. But what he didn't know was that the other end of the road, waiting for him, was a huge danger.

At the other end of the road was the entrance to an underground garage, about 2.2 meters from the ground.

There are no warning signs.

![](/assets/img/posts/access8.jpeg)

This picture is the garage where Jun Wen fell, the warning sign was placed after the accident.

In the dark night, even a person with a healthy limb could't keep falling, not to mention that he was in a wheelchair. Jun fell off the top of the 2.2-meter-high garage. No one knows how desperate he was at the time. When the security found him and when the ambulance arrived, he lost vital signs already.

It looks like a flat, open road from the other end.

In the later surveillance video, the family members saw that Jun, who was shaking the wheelchair, suddenly disappeared.

![](/assets/img/posts/access9.jpeg)

It is inferred that Jun in a wheelchair is half-squat and couldn't see the entrance at all. And by the time he saw it, he already had no time to react.


After confirming the news of Jun's death, a patient of his bursted out crying.

It was like a huge irony, stabbed in the throat and tied in the heart of us.

**Afterwards, the entrance to the underground garage was put on a warning sign. It’s just that the price of this warning sign is too heavy.**

After that, everyone wanted to fulfill the wishes of Jun, but they found that the ability of their own group is not as good as Jun alone.

In order to promote barrier-free travel accessibility, in order to make every patient's life valuable, who could think of how much Jun risks when he went out alone to explore the path? Who could know how much courage and perseverance Jun has paid?

The patients said that Jun is really cautious, and this was nearly impossible to happen.

But yet it still happened.

In fact, even if they break free of their inner shackles, and they are willing to walk out of their homes, is it just the tactile paving that was occupied by vehicles that stops them?

In March 2013, a 25-year-old young man Yonggang Zhu, who had lower limbs disablity , was preparing to take a train back to his hometown from Zhengzhou.

He arrived at the train station early and took a long time to find a barrier-free passage.

However, the door was well locked and there was no contact number.

![](/assets/img/posts/access10.jpeg)

He asked other passengers to call help but no staff responded. 

It was only after 12 minutes of train departure time that he met a passing staff member.

The staff told him that he could change the ticket. But he still didn't offer a solution to get inside the station

When Yonggang asked why they didn't reserve a phone next to the barrier-free passage, the staff's attitude was very bad, saying, "Why don't I just pick you up at your home??"

Yonggang felt really uncomfortable. He just wanted to go home, but he missed it, plus got angry because of the incident.

In desperation, Yonggang sued Zhengzhou Railway Bureau to Zhengzhou Railway Transport Court and asked Zhengzhou Railway Bureau to compensate his ticket for 10.5 yuan and apologize.

![](/assets/img/posts/access11.jpeg)

When the reporter learned about the situation of the barrier-free passage from the Zhengzhou Railway Station, they responded that the lock was to prevent ordinary passengers from escaping.

Passengers with physical disabilities must be accompanied by their family members to explain the situation before they could open the passage.

"However, since you're already inconvenient to travel, it is best to have family members to accompany you."

This kind of response did not seem to encourage people with disabilities to travel. 

Also in this year, the Beijing Morning Post reported on the tactile paving in Beijing.

![](/assets/img/posts/access12.jpeg)

Beijing's tactile paving is nearly 1,600 kilometers long and the world's first in length, enough to spread from Beijing to Changsha.

But length does not mean quality.

tactile pavings can be constructed on the five-ring roads for international visitors where pedestrians are scarce, but they are never constructed to enter banks, hospitals, or residential areas.

Even if it did, the phenomenon of being occupied is everywhere.

![](/assets/img/posts/access13.jpeg)

In the interview, the interviewees mentioned that if they walk along the tactile paving, “there are few times that they could walk in the right way”, “Jumping straight to the outside dining table of restaurants, and “walking along the tactile paving is suicidal”.

In Shenyang, a blind person was walking on tactile pavings. When he encountered a car, he knocked on the car with a cane and then he got beaten by the car driver.

In 2015, blind singer Yunpeng Zhou played a video of tactile paving walking on his own tour.

He encountered all kinds of obstacles: it was a tactile paving, but there were roadblocks on it. Then, a whole row was occupied by bicycles, and he was almost stumped by obstacles.

The world is big, but there is only one way of walk left for them.

There are more than 17 million blind people across the country, and the length of the tactile paving has already exceeded the number of blind people.

However, how many people have gone out of their homes, stepped onto the tactile paving, and went further through the tactile paving?

They don't want to, just can't, don't dare.

Every time they go out, they need to have the courage to give out life.

In fact, let alone blind people and disabled people go out alone, a normal sick old man, accompanied by his family, couldn't go anywhere outside.

After the death of the Jun Wen, in a commemoration post, a netizen shared his own experience.

At the beginning of July, the netizen’s father had a knee operation in Changsha, Hunan, and went home by high-speed rail.

**The road to the subway station was only 1 kilometer, but because the sidewalk was blocked by motor vehicles, he could only push the wheelchair to walk on the roadway.**

![](/assets/img/posts/access15.jpeg)

He had to avoid the pits under the feet and pay attention to the vehicles on the road.

Waiting at the subway station, he then found that the subway gate could only be used by normal people, and wheelchairs cannot get through.

He begged the staff to open the railing before they could enter.

But then the height difference between the subway and the platform floor caused stuck of the front wheel of the wheelchair. He had to ask for other passengers to help lift the wheelchair.

![](/assets/img/posts/access16.jpeg)

However, when he pushed the wheelchair and got off the subway, he heard a passenger behind him complaining: "Why do these disabled people taking subway??"

His father just did a small operation, and who can guarantee that he will not get sick for a lifetime?

Not only the elderly, but also the babies, they could barely move at most places.

In 2018, Dihua Li, a professor at the School of Architecture and Landscape Design at Peking University, boarded the "One Seat" podium. He told us with his own experience that such situations exist everywhere.

In order to experience the travel environment of disabled people, he would take the students to rent wheelchairs, baby strollers and crutches, and go to the park to play.

But the process was not pleasant.

It was obviously a small park, but the stroller couldn't be pushed down at all. It could only be lifted.

![](/assets/img/posts/access17.jpeg)

If at this moment a mother is driving a baby stroller alone, what should she do?

The wheel of the wheelchair would be stuck in the gap between the stones at any time. Who knows how dangerous this is?

![](/assets/img/posts/access18.jpeg)

He couldn't help but say this for a lot of times: impossible to walk, impossible to walk, impossible to walk...

Look at these following pictures:

How do you push the stroller and walk through this kind of sidewalk?

![](/assets/img/posts/access19.jpeg)

Is this a barrier-free passage, or do you want to give the wheelchair an acceleration?

![](/assets/img/posts/access20.jpeg)

In fact, let alone the elderly and children, many designs in the city even make normal people helpless. For example, this square, from the bottom up, has no problem.

![](/assets/img/posts/access21.jpeg)

But if you go up and look down, you can't see the steps at all.

![](/assets/img/posts/access22.jpeg)

Some people may ask, is there any problem with this?

Let's imagine if there are children playing in the square, chasing and running. They can't see the steps below, they just rush straight down, what will happen?

If you want to across this road, should you follow the traffic rules and take the zebra crossing?

![](/assets/img/posts/access23.jpeg)

If you are riding by bicycle from here on a raining day.

![](/assets/img/posts/access24.jpeg)

If you walk from here with your head down at night.

![](/assets/img/posts/access25.jpeg)

If you pass by here at night.

![](/assets/img/posts/access26.jpeg)

If all of the above scenes happen, who could guarantee that a person without disabilities could walk through safely?

### The end

In life, we might have an impression that we are almost inaccessible to people with disabilities.

The truth is that there are now 85 million people with disabilities in China.

One out of every 16 people. This is not a small number.

It’s not that they don’t exist, they just can’t get out.

They are not a minority.

![](/assets/img/posts/access27.jpeg)

And apart from them, there are those pregnant women, those children, those old people, who may be each of us.

Because we were all children, and we will grow old one day.

At that time, living in this unfriendly environment, how should we behave ourselves?

Maybe we have gotten used to everything: we got used to park the bicycles, private cars anywhere, we got used to just lift our legs to pass the obstacles on the road.

Because, it has always been the case.

Just like the private car that blocked Jun Wen, the owner felt that there was no problem, because everyone did it.

Just like the hotel did not place a hazard sign at the entrance to the garage, because there has never been a problem.

However, what makes "never been a problem" right?
